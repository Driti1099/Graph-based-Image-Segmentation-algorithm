INTRODUCTION:
Graph-based image segmentation is a popular technique in computer vision that aims to partition an 
image into meaningful regions or objects. It formulates image segmentation as a graph optimization 
problem, where the image pixels are represented as nodes in a graph, and the edges between nodes 
encode the similarity or dissimilarity between pixels.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Image Pre-processing: The initial step involves pre-processing the input image to enhance its 
quality or simplify its representation. This may include tasks such as resizing, noise reduction, color 
space conversion, or contrast enhancement.
2. Graph Construction: A graph is constructed to represent the image, where each pixel corresponds 
to a node in the graph. The nodes are connected by edges that capture the relationships between 
pixels. The type of graph used (e.g., grid graph, neighbourhood graph) and the method of edge 
construction (e.g., based on color similarity, spatial proximity) depend on the specific algorithm or 
approach.
3. Weight Calculation: This step often involves computing the difference in color, texture, or other 
feature descriptors between adjacent pixels. 
4. Graph Partitioning: The graph is partitioned into distinct regions or segments using graph 
partitioning algorithms. These algorithms aim to find a partition that optimizes a certain objective 
function. 
5. Post-processing: After the initial segmentation, post-processing steps can be performed to refine 
the results. This may involve merging or splitting segments based on certain criteria, removing small 
or noisy segments, or applying smoothing operations to improve segment boundaries.
6. Visualization and Analysis: Finally, the segmented image or the extracted regions can be 
visualized and further analysed for downstream tasks such as object recognition, image 
understanding, or computer vision applications.
